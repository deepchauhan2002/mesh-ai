# The New ~Bing~ Everything

A simple implementation of ChatGPT API in an attempt to replicate the "new Bing" in an extensible manner.

The code is a bit crappy given its mostly written by AI at this point :)

## Usage

Set your OpenAI API Key in `.env`

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jererobles/mesh-ai.git
cd mesh-ai
echo "<your_key>" > .env
```

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun index.ts
```

## How it works

This section in WIP.

### Persona

Just like no single human has the knowledge or is trained to do every task, it is unreasonable to expect one model with a fixed set of parameters to handle every user input.

A Persona is just an instance of GPT3.5 with a predetermined set of parameters and optionally a conversation seed, a `transformer` function and a `validation` function. See [other/personas.ts](https://github.com/jererobles/mesh-ai/blob/main/other/personas.ts) for more information.

### API

Any backend system that the AI may decide to call. We avoid implementing too much website-specific parsing logic as these are prone to break over time — instead we prefer to let the language models make sense of the context by translating it to something more amenable to the AI e.g. HTML -> Markdown.

### Model

Representing a model from OpenAI — an API key is required to use it but this may change in the future if we decide to support offline usage. DaVinci and ChatGPT-3.5 are the ones implemented so far but only the latter is actually used.

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v0.5.7. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
