# The New ~Bing~ Everything

A simple implementation of the ChatGPT API in an attempt to replicate the "new Bing" in an extensible manner.

## Demo

## Usage

Set your OpenAI API Key in `.env`

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jererobles/mesh-ai.git
cd mesh-ai
echo "<your_key>" > .env
```

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun index.ts
```

## How it works

This section is a WIP.

### Persona

Just like no single human has the knowledge or is trained to do every task, it is unreasonable to expect one model with a fixed set of parameters to handle every user input.

A Persona is just an instance of GPT3.5 with a predefined set of parameters and more importantly, a conversation seed that defines the capabilities and personality of the agent. It is also possible, although optional, to pass a `transformer` function and a `validation` function. See [other/personas.ts](https://github.com/jererobles/mesh-ai/blob/main/other/personas.ts) for more information.

### API

Any backend system that the AI may decide to call. We avoid implementing too much website-specific parsing logic as these are prone to break over time — instead we prefer to let the language model make sense of the context by translating it to something more amenable e.g. HTML -> Markdown.

### Model

Representing a model from OpenAI — an API key is required to use it but this may change in the future if we decide to support offline usage. DaVinci and ChatGPT-3.5 are the ones implemented so far but only the latter is actually used.

## Caveats

- code needs more time than I can dedicate in a weekend meaning lots of parts need to be refactored
- although Personas support _some_ limited logic using the functions mentioned above, **the intention is to craft the seed messages in order to produce the desired output** — with the one exception of the "final" response which may contain special keywords injected in the response that the stream parser can pick up on in order to decide if a web search is required
- sometimes the model's limitations leak through for example in the demo video the identified topic refers to a strike that happened in 2021 even though the model correctly identified that it lacked recent enough data to reply and therefore chose to do a web search — which correctly provided information about the ongoing strike in 2023

## To Do

- [x] initial PoC
- [x] silly blog post
- [ ] refactoring (??)
- [ ] support more search engines such as DDG
- [ ] image and video search
- [ ] define more Personas
  - [ ] map Personas to topics to answer in different voices or further refine results

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v0.5.7. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
